    "**Ans**: The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that promotes the organization of code in a modular, reusable, and understandable manner. OOP aims to structure programs around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key goals of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **<code>Modularity</code>**: OOP encourages the decomposition of complex systems into smaller, self-contained modules called objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **<code>Encapsulation</code>**: OOP supports encapsulation by hiding the internal details and complexities of an object from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **<code>Abstraction</code>**: OOP emphasizes abstraction by focusing on the essential characteristics and behaviors of an object while hiding irrelevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **<code>Inheritance</code>**: OOP provides inheritance as a mechanism for creating new classes based on existing classes. Inheritance allows the reuse of common attributes and behaviors defined in a base (parent) class, reducing code duplication and promoting code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **<code>Polymorphism</code>**: OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass."
